## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/matthew-jl/PHiscord.git
    cd PHiscord
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Using Yarn (recommended):

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

    Or using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**

    - Navigate into the `renderer` directory:
      ```bash
      cd renderer
      ```
    - Copy the example environment file:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env.local
      ```
    - Edit the newly created `renderer/.env.local` file and add your Firebase project configuration keys and any other required variables. Refer to the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section below.

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    or
